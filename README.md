# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

There is a [top code kata video](https://youtu.be/SvcJKNF_nRQ) explaining why you might want to try this refactoring kata. The original exercise was designed by Jon Jagger and is available in his Cyber-Dojo. See [his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html). I have changed it a little, so that the rules more closely match what I'm used to.

## Kata Description

The problem that this code is designed to solve is explained here: [Yatzy](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/yatzy.html)

## Contributing to this Kata
Please do not send me your refactored solutions. I am however grateful for language translations and updates to dependencies.

I recently added new refactoring challenges to the Java version and I would appreciate translations of Yatzy2 and Yatzy3 in other languages.

## Code Reading Practice
Test your code reading skills. Here is a description of what to do: [Scanning for Code Smells](https://sammancoaching.org/exercises/code_reading.html). There are suitable lists of urls to open in some of the language subdirectories.
There are three variants of this kata each with different refactoring challenges.
